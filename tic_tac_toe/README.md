## Description

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game that can be played by two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid and the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the grid is filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply run

```node tic-tac-toe-single.js``` (for single player mode) or

from the command line.
