# Connect 4

## Description

Connect 4 is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

## How to play

Run the game by executing the following command in the terminal:

```node connect4-single.js``` (for single player mode)

```node connect4-double.js``` (for 2 player mode)
